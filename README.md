# Easily Convert Temperature in Your Head

Example web app for converting temperature, with steps for quick mental calculation:

* [app.html](https://github.com/hchiam/embeddedGame/blob/master/app.html) is for the structure ("organization").
* [app.js](https://github.com/hchiam/embeddedGame/blob/master/app.js) is for the interaction ("actions").
* [app.css](https://github.com/hchiam/embeddedGame/blob/master/app.css) is for extra presentation stuff ("style"/"looks").
